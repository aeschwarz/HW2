<p> I am originally from Darien, IL, which is a Southwest Suburb of Chicago.  I went to Hinsdale South High School and played football and baseball while I was there.  I have one brother (Matt, 23) and one sister (Lindsey, 19).  My first job was working for Panera Bread; doing anything from making the food to washing dishes (not at the same time obviously).  After I quit there, I started working for a small sports retail company, Pro Jersey Sports.  I still currently work there during school breaks and summers.  Also, for the past three summers I have worked for my city's public works department.  I started my first job on campus here this fall.  I am working for the CRWC at the membership services desk.  I am the one who checks your ID's in order to gain access to the Rec (tough I know). </p>
<p> I have grown up my whole life surrounded by sports.  Throughout my life I have played baseketball, baseball, football, and hockey.  I have never played soccer before and that is something that I take pride in.  Hockey is without a doubt my favorite sport.  The Chicago Blackhawks are my favorite team and in my opinion have the best logo in all of sports.  I would have to say that football comes next, followed by baseball and basketball.  I am a Chicago fan for every team except for the Cubs. </p>

<p> For fun I like to hangout with friends, watch tv, play videogames, workout.  As of right now my favorite show is Breaking Bad and I am not really sure what I am going to do once it's over.  My favorite video game is the NHL series, I usually buy the updated version every September.  Lately, I have been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto 5.  I should have waited to buy it though so that I can get all of this work done first.  I also like playing Madden and Call of Duty. </p>
